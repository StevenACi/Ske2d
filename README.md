This is a simple base for a danmaku style game. 
If you're unfamiliar with what that is, 
it is like Geometry wars, with RPG elements - at least this one is.

So far we have a template for a character controlled sprite and one kind of enemy.

Levels:
We should have 10 stages per world, with a cutscene between worlds 

Bosses?:
We will have a boss at the end of every level, in normal Danmaku style.


Original Sprites:
so far the sprites can be credited to Vampire Savior 1, and some megaman game.
